Q6. What is the difference between a singly linked list and a circularly linked list?

The difference between a singly linked list and a circularly linked list is:
- A singly linked list's last node points to null whereas the circular doesn't
- The singly has a head node implemented whereas the circular doesn't, it only has the tail


Q7. In what situations would you prefer to use a linked list to an array?

You would prefer a linked list over an array if you want to add or remove constantly without having to reinitialise and transfer all data into a new array (since the array is fixed at allocation). It would also be good if you didn't know the size (the amount of elements in teh structure)


Q8. Describe 2 possible use-cases for a circularly linked list (2-3 sentences for each).

A circularly linked list could be used if you wanted to make a playlist and you wanted it to be cyclic or if you wanted to have stacked widgets on your phone that returns loops around when you reach the end
